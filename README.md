This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

## Quick Overview

This is a small project I created for personal usage. It allows to track the sum of currently owned cryptocurrencies converted to chosen currency, e.g. Polish Zlotych.

This was a quick project, to test the possibilities of React Native.

## How I feel about React Native
React native is really cool, and might be useful. Altough even is my simple application I saw some performance problems, and different behaviours in development vs. production version. For a higher-grade application I would go towards native solutions, but for smaller projects, in companies that are focused on the web, it is a really useful solution.
